# 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio

Hi, I'm Muhammad Khadafi — a security researcher and junior penetration tester specializing in:

🧪 Black-Box Web Application Pentesting
🔍 API Security & Business Logic Testing
🐛 Bug Bounty & Vulnerability Research

# ⚙️ Offensive Security Methodology & Recon

I enjoy analyzing real-world applications, finding subtle logic flaws, and writing clear, structured vulnerability reports.
My learning path is hands-on, practical, and research-driven.

# 🚀 Skills & Focus Areas
Category	Skills / Tools

Labs & CTF	Hack The Box, TryHackMe

# 📂 Portfolio Contents

## 💰 1. Bug Bounty Journey

### /bug-bounty-reports

api-dos-escalation.md
Submitted → validated as Informational, currently under review for PoC escalation.

error-driven-graphql-schema-discovery.md
Submitted → Validated as Informational, GraphQL schema leak & authorization behavior exposure

✦ These reports demonstrate reconnaissance, API analysis, PoC construction, and professional reporting workflow.

## 🎯 2. Pentesting Projects

### 📁 /Pentesting-projects

freelance-web-app-pentest-celoofficial.pdf
Black-box assessment using OWASP methodologies: enumeration, validation, risk scoring, and reporting.

## 🔬 3. Lab Notes & Write-ups (HTB / THM)

### 📁 /labs-writeups

HTB – Oopsie
Enumeration → misconfig exploitation → privilege escalation → lessons learned.

I use these documents to maintain consistency and track personal improvement.

# 🧭 Current Mission

Sharpening offensive security skills through real-world testing, structured reporting, and continuous iteration.

# 🌟 Goals:

🔄 Improve report quality & documentation
🎯 Focus on impactful vulns (Auth bypass, IDOR/BOLA, GraphQL/API flaws, logic bugs)
💼 Grow toward Pentester role / Red Team role

# 🧠 Closing Note
Security isn't just about finding bugs — it's about understanding how systems fail, why they fail, and communicating those insights clearly.
