# 🧪 Lab Write-ups (HTB & TryHackMe)

This directory contains my hands-on lab write-ups from **Hack The Box** and **TryHackMe**, focused on building real offensive security skills through practical exploitation, methodology, and attacker mindset.

These write-ups follow responsible guidelines:
- **No flags exposed**
- **No harmful payloads**
- **No direct exploit code for HTB**
- **100% learning and documentation oriented**

# 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

These labs demonstrate my progression as a penetration tester through real-world techniques:

- Web app exploitation  
- Access control testing (IDOR, BOLA, logic flaws)  
- File upload attacks  
- Linux privilege escalation  
- Reconnaissance & enumeration  
- Attack surface mapping  
- API interaction & auth analysis  

Each write-up emphasizes:
- **How I think**, not just what commands I run  
- **Why a vulnerability exists**  
- **How to recognize similar patterns in real systems**

# 🧠 Learning Philosophy

I document these labs not to collect flags, but to sharpen:

- Systematic enumeration  
- Hypothesis-driven testing  
- Pattern recognition  
- Real attack chains  
- Clean documentation & reporting  

This mirrors real pentesting workflows and helps me grow toward professional roles in offensive security.

- More HTB boxes  
- TryHackMe attack-path labs  
- API exploitation scenarios  
- Linux PrivEsc drills  
- Red team–style chains

**Security is a journey, not a destination - and these labs document that journey.**
