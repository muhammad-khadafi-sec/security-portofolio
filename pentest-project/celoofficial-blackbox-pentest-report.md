# Penetration Testing Report

Target: celoofficial.com

Date: 30 Oktober 2025

Assessment Type: Black Box Web Application Pentest

Prepared by: Muhammad Khadafi — Junior Penetration Tester

## 1. Executive Summary

A black-box penetration test was performed against celoofficial.com to identify weaknesses that could expose system details, user data, or increase the attack surface.

Two vulnerabilities were discovered:

 - Path Disclosure via API error messages

 - EXIF Metadata Exposure containing personally identifiable information

No exploitation, privilege escalation, or destructive actions were attempted.
Both findings demonstrate information exposure issues that could support reconnaissance or future targeted attacks.

Overall Severity: Medium

## 2. Scope & Authorization

**In Scope**

 - ✔ Public Website
 - ✔ Public API

**Not Performed**

 - ✖ Credential Bruteforce
 - ✖ Exploitation / PrivEsc

**Out of Scope**

 - ✖ Social Engineering
 - ✖ Infrastructure Attacks

## 3. Methodology

The assessment followed:

 - OWASP Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)

 - PTES (Penetration Testing Execution Standard)

Activities performed:

 - Passive Reconnaissance

 - Active Recon (non-intrusive)

 - Error Behavior Testing

 - Metadata Inspection

No payload execution or intrusion attempts were performed.

## 4. Tools Used

| Category               | Tools                                  |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Reconnaissance         | Browser DevTools, crt.sh, Dig, WHOIS    |
| Metadata Inspection    | exiftool                                |
| Manual Testing         | Burp Suite (basic proxy), Custom URLs   |
| OS / Environment       | Linux, Terminal Utilities               |

## 5. Findings Summary

| ID    | Vulnerability                         | Severity | CVSS (Est.) | Status      |
|-------|----------------------------------------|----------|-------------|-------------|
| F-01  | Path Disclosure via API Error Message  | Medium   | 5.3         | Identified  |
| F-02  | EXIF Metadata Exposure (PII Leak)      | Medium   | 4.8         | Identified  |

## 6. Detailed Findings

### F-01 Path Disclosure via /api Response

Description

Requests to:

/api

/product-category/api

return PHP error responses that disclose internal file paths, directories, and backend structure.

### Impact

 - Expands attacker reconnaissance capability

 - Enables targeted payload planning (LFI/RFI, traversal, debugging abuse)

 - Reveals architectural linkage between components

### Proof of Concept

GET https://celoofficial.com/api
GET https://celoofficial.com/product-category/api

### Recommendation

 - Implement generic error responses (HTTP 403/404)
 - Ensure exception handling does not return server-side paths
 - Disable detailed error reporting on production

---

### F-02 Personal Metadata Exposure in Image Files

Description

Several public images contain EXIF metadata, which include:

 - Author Name

 - Creator Tool

 - Internal workflow metadata

Proof of Concept

exiftool <imagefile>

Impact

 - Enables targeted phishing/social engineering

 - Can reveal internal roles or identity relationships

 - Exposes unnecessary operational details to attackers

Recommendation

 - Strip EXIF metadata before publishing assets

 - Automate metadata cleaning in CI/CD or CMS

 - Reprocess existing exposed images

## 7. Exploitation Status

 - No exploitation performed

 - No unauthorized access attempted

 - All testing was observational & safe

## 8. Conclusion

Although the target environment is generally secure, information exposure issues were identified that can aid reconnaissance and future attacks. Fixing these findings will strengthen security posture and reduce risk.
